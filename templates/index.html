<p>In January 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Florida's policy of imposing the death penalty, ruling the state gives too much power to the judges and not enough to juries in deciding, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/12/22/florida-supreme-court-says-hundreds-of-death-row-inmates-may-get-new-sentences-and-avoid-execution/">Washington Post.</a> </p>

    <p>Because of the overturning of Florida's policy, this has left many in limbo.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, 371 people sit on death row. Following the Court's opinion, the justices decided the Supreme Court ruling would only apply to cases after 2002, according to the <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/florida-supreme-court-death-penalty-cases-finalized-before-2002-will-stand/2307180">Tampa Bay Times.</a></p>
